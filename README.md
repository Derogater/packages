if you want to add all the packages yourself then delete "node_module"(folder), "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files and then run the first line of command with all the required packages included in it.



as for those who only want to copy the packages in these file then delete "node_module" folder and "package-lock.json" file and copy the structured data in this file(which is all except the first line).
